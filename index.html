      <p>
        At UAT, we’ve been working hard to prepare our campus to reopen as safely
        as possible. With a few Jedi tricks and a lot of preparation
        from our staff, we are ready to welcome you back. !!!!!Here are!!!!LEGG TIL LINK!!
         some helpful guides to review as you're making your
         preparations to return to campus. May the force—and your
          mask—be with you.
          With respect to scheduling and social distancing guidelines,
           some UAT classes will return to live (in-person)
           instruction on Wednesday, October 28. As stated previously,
            a virtual component will remain for every class,
             regardless of modality. Most classes will have a
             reduced in-person capacity. As the 28th approaches,
             please check your UAT email and keep an eye out for
             Canvas announcements regarding your in-person attendance
             options and how to sign up.
